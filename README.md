### About Me

<img align="right" width="330" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/talhazahid/talhaz/main/code.gif" alt="Code GIF" />

I'm Talha, a Product Designer who loves building meaningful products that bring people together.

Vibe coding is my favorite way to build. I love exploring different LLM models and turning ideas into real, usable tools people can enjoy right away. I'm always experimenting, shipping free apps, websites, and Figma plugins, and refining them based on community feedback.

I like audiobooks and love gaming, especially **Dota 2**, **Age of Empires 4**, and **Counter-Strike**.

Hellooo & memes 😄
